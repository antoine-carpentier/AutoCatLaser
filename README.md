# AutoCatLaser

AutoCatLaser is a Raspberry Pi project aiming at entertaining my cats with minimal effort from me/while being out of town. 

See AutoCatLaser Setup and Demo video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJFl5sFPFbk).

This project is based on [this article by Sam Storino](https://storiknow.com/automatic-cat-laser-pointer-toy-using-the-raspberry-pi/).
More specifically, the `LaserWrapper.py` and `GmailWrapper.py` files were taken from [part 4](https://storiknow.com/automatic-cat-laser-pointer-toy-using-raspberry-pi-part-four/) of the article and adapted for my needs.


## Components needed:
- a Raspberry Pi (I used a [Raspberry Pi Zero W](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B072N3X39J/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1))
- a Raspberry Camera (I bought [this cheap one](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07M9Q43MX/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1))
- a PCA9685 PWM controller and two servos (I bought [this](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0874CFBX8/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1))
- a bright red dot laser ([these work](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B071FT9HSV/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1), although a lot of them were dim)
- an active buzzer
- two NPN transistors
- a button
- a bunch of jumper wires ([this kit](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01GHVNP0M/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) contains the buzzer, NPN transistors, button and wires I used)
